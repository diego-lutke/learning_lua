# Learning Lua

- This is just a small project to learn the nuances of Lua and Git/Github itself;
- I'm gonna try to kept this minimum with only one file .lua where I'll put all the little experiments;
- It's not a serious project, so don't take the code here as something optimal;
- Everything will be commented, maybe I'll leave the last block of code  uncommented;
- Because is a learning process, feel free to give me tips if you find something that could be done different.
